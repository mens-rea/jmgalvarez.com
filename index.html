          <h3>Character Name: Juan Miguel G. Alvarez</h3>
          <p>
              I have been earning food by writing beautiful and elegant codes for the past 7 years now. I've been writing poems to computers since I was in college. Created a tech-consultancy company called <a href="https://potatocodes.com/" target="_blank">Potatocodes Inc</a>. We won in some hackathons. I did seminars and workshops across various universities in the Philippines talking about game development, leadership, business and programming. I've also been featured in various talk shows and radio segments. Worked for another startup called <a href="https://wanderast.com/" target="_blank">Wanderast</a>. Travelled all over south-east asia and met tons of wonderful people. I taught computer science for a year in a private university. 
              </br></br>
              I got married to the most beautiful and inspiring woman I can possibly meet on this planet and we're currently living together in Vietnam enjoying vietnamese food and culture. I'm working as a remote software engineer for companies and startups in the USA and Australia. I am a proud member of the UST Startup Community and part of an ongoing sustainability media platform called <a href="https://offcrowd.com/" target="_blank">Offcrowd</a>. I would like to explore data science more in the near future and dive into various technologies like [neural network, machine learning, swarm technology]. It's interesting to see how we can apply all these technologies in solving seemingly impossible problems.
