          <h3>Character Name: Juan Miguel G. Alvarez</h3>
          <p>
              I have been earning food by writing beautiful and elegant codes for the past 7 years now (the beautiful and elegant part mostly in the latter years). I've been writing poems to computers since I was in college. Created a company called Potatocodes and failed a lot. Won in some hackathons. I did seminars and workshops across various universities in the Philippines. Worked for another startup called Wanderast. Travelled all over and met tons of wonderful people. I taught computer science for a year in a private university. I got married to the most beautiful and inspiring woman I can possibly meet on this planet. 
              </br></br>
              I'm currently living with my wife in Vietnam enjoying the delicious food. I'm working as a remote software developers for companies and startups in the US and Australia. I would like to explore data science more in the near future and delve in neural networks and machine learning in general. For me it's really interesting to see how we can apply all these technologies in solving seemingly impossible problems.
            </p>
